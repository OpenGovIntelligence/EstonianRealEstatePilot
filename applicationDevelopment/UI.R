    of Economic Affairs and Communications and Tallinn University of Technology.
    The purpose of this pilot program is to fight information asymmetry in the real estate market and
    provide an easy way to access real estate data. The pilot is intended to give real estate agents, property developers,
    investors, and those involved in the real estate market (buyers, sellers, renters, students, new arrivals etc.)
    a deeper knowledge of the marketplace.",
