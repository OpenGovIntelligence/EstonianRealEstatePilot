# EstonianRealEstatePilot

The Estonian pilot program is one of 6 pilot programs being carried out by the OGI project. This pilot program is being carried out by The Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications  and Tallinn University of Technology. The purpose of this pilot program is to fight information asymmetry in the real estate market and provide an easy way to access real estate data. The pilot is intended to give real estate agents, property developers, investors, and those involved in the real estate market (buyers, sellers, renters, students, new arrivals etc.) a deeper knowledge of the marketplace.  
The pilots follow agile methodology and will be organized in three iterations: the first one (initial) will 
put an early version of the evaluation of OpenGovIntelligence services and tools, the second one will put a more advanced version and the last one the final version. The final iteration of pilots will also benefit from the lessons learned in the first two pilot iterations. 
The first phase of the pilot program will be a user workshop. The goal of the user workshop is to start 
a conversation with relevant stakeholders about the pilot program and gain valuable input. Inclusion of stakeholders and end users is necessary for co-creation of a new data driven public service. The user workshop will aim to identify any issues or problems with the pilot program, potential solutions for these  issues,  develop  ideas  for  the  user  interface  of  the  pilot,  develop  use  cases,  user  stories,  and personas.  Ultimately  the goal of the Estonian pilot program is to develop a new data-driven public service in cooperation with the end users. After the conclusion of the user workshop the first implementation  of the pilot will take place. Further user workshops may be carried out for following iterations of the pilot development in line with the agile methodology presented by the OGI project.
